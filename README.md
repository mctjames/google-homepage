Learning html by mkaing the google homepage.

In this project I hope to use the html and css that I have been learning over the past month. Given that this will be my first project
where the training wheels get taken off I expect things to get messy. I will check back in after I finish to write out the skills that
I used and learned while doing the project. 

Test 1 - saving to git from my computer

Update as of Jan 2nd - I am starting to get things into position. I think I need to read up on classes and lists again. I suspect using those two things would make the process easier.
