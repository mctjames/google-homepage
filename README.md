# google-homepage
Learning html by making the google homepage.

In this project I hope to use the html and css that I have been learning over the past month. Given that this will be my first project
where the training wheels get taken off I expect things to get messy. I will check back in after I finish to write out the skills that
I used and learned while doing the project. 

Test 1 - saving to git from my computer

Update as of Jan 2nd - I am starting to get things into position. I think I need to read up on classes and lists again. I suspect using those two things would make the process easier. 

Final update - This process mostly taught me to switch between whatever I had just googled and my text editor in the hopes that the information I had found on google was useful. I also managed to get a better sense of how css and html work together. If I were to do this project again from the ground up I would probably make better use of classes so that I spent less time adjusting specific parts of the code and having to do it again and again for each link. Additionally I could stand to adjust some of the fonts, the bottom nav bar doesnt reach the left side of my screen and some of the icons I used do not have hover effects.
